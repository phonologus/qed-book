The Qed Book
============

The _Qed Book_ is intended to be a tutorial, both basic and advanced,
for the _Qed_ text editor.

It is currently in a very incomplete draft state. The advanced part of the
tutorial is the most complete, and it is an edited version of
Rob Pike's original _Qed Tutorial_. It has been updated in places
to reflect the changes that Rob had made to the register and arithmetic
language since the original release of his tutorial.

The basic part is being written by me (when I have the spare time!),
and is intended to bring users unfamiliar with the *ed*-way of
text-editing up to speed, and ready to tackle Rob's tutorial.

Over time, I hope to be able to make more revisions to Rob's tutorial
to make some of the examples less anachronistic, and to go into
more detail in certain (interesting) areas.

I have chosen to use `asciidoc` as the format simply because I like the
default `html` and `pdf` outputs, and, despite a few annoyances, it
is reasonably easy to learn-forget-relearn-reforget....

The evolution of Rob's tutorial from his original `troff` manuscript
through to the current `asciidoc` version can be tracked in the
`git` history of my now obsolete first port of _Qed_ [here][Q].

Repository Notes
================

This Github repository is a mirror of my private `fossil` repository.
I am experimenting with the `fossil` -> Github workflow, so bear
with me!
